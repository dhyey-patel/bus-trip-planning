# Bus Trip Planning

In the project we will take some very simple maps (given in a text form) and parse them into a graph. In the map there are streets (graph edges) and there are locations (graph nodes). There will be a single bus line the runs on every single street and using this information the goal is to get from the start to the destination with the minimum number of bus changes.

The code will use various graphing algorithms to find different paths from start to destination, and will eventually choose the one with the least bus changes.

There are 9 different map configurations that the code is run on
